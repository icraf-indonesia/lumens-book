# Planning unit reconciliation {#sec-reconcile}

## Description

This module can be used to develop rules to resolve conflicting perspectives on land allocation. This module allows modification to the planning unit attribute table and dissolve planning unit per unique ID. Planning unit reconciliation is a process to resolve overlapping permits by referring to function reference maps. Reconciliation is done by analyzing how well the permit data matches the reference data.

## Usage

### Workflow

Data Preparation

(1) Unresolved Case Map (Shape file format) Shape file of overlayed planning units with some layer that conflict, defined as unresolved case.

(2) Unresolved Case Attribute (CSV format) Detailed unresolved case table. Before running PUR Reconcile module, the reconcile action (drop-down selection) on 'PUR_unresolved_case.xlsx' need to be defined. You can use Microsoft Excel or any free spreadsheet software (e.g. Google Sheet) to do it.

    If you want to add a new class on ‘reconcile action’, the steps are:

    a)  Unhide the sheet, you will see ‘drop-down_attribute’

    b)  Click Data \> Data Validation

        Source \> Block the columns you want to add

    c)  Open the ‘PUR_unresolved_case’ sheet, click data validation. Fill in the source the same as written in the ‘drop-down_attribute.

### Model Description

The PUR module helps identify the location and extent of various overlapping area designations. These results can then be used as a basis for more open and directed discussions in the process of updating planning units.
