## 1. Description

\[Concise overview of the module's function and purpose within LUMENS.
Connect it to real-world planning challenges faced by policymakers.
Example: *This module analyses land use/cover change trends, helping stakeholders understand historical and land use change patterns, informing xxx strategies.*\]

## 2. Usage

### 2.1 Workflow

\[Summarize the key steps involved in using the module, providing a roadmap for users.
Example: *Users upload land cover maps for different time periods, select analysis parameters, and the module generates maps and statistics of land use change.*\]

### 2.2 Step-by-step instructions

**Step 1: Uploading Land Cover Data**

\[Detailed instructions with screenshots.
Example: - *Click the "Upload Raster" button in the "Data" tab.* - *Select your land cover map (GeoTIFF format) from your computer.* - *Ensure the map is projected to UTM and has a resolution of at least 100 m x 100 m* - *(Screenshot of the data upload interface)*\]

**Step 2: Setting Analysis Parameters**

\[Instructions for each parameter with explanations of their effect.
Example: - *Time Period:* Select the start and end years for your analysis.
- *Transition Matrix:* Choose whether to calculate a transition matrix showing land use changes between categories.
- *(Screenshot of the parameter selection area)*\]

**Step 3: Running the Analysis**

\[Instructions on how to initiate the analysis and what to expect.
Example: - *Click the "Run Analysis" button.* - *A progress bar will appear, indicating the analysis status.* - *Once complete, the results will be displayed in the "Results" tab.* - *(Screenshot of the "Run Analysis" button and progress bar)*\]

### 2.3 Tips

-   \[Provide helpful hints or things to consider while using the module. Example:
    -   *For large datasets, the analysis may take some time to complete.*
    -   *Ensure that all input maps have the same extent and resolution.* \]

| 1\. | Land Cover Map (Time 1) | Categorical raster | GeoTIFF | UTM                     | A map classifying land use types for the start year. |
| 2\. | Land Cover Map (Time 2) | Categorical raster | GeoTIFF | UTM                     | A map classifying land use types for the end year.   |
| ... | ...                     | ...                | ...     | ...                     | ...                                                  |

\[Include rows for ALL required input data and parameters.\]

### 3.2 Example Datasets

\[Provide links to sample datasets users can download and use for practice.\]

### 3.3 Data Acquisition

\[Provide guidance on finding suitable data, linking to common sources if applicable.
Example: - *Land cover maps can often be obtained from \[link to data source\].* - *For creating your own land cover maps from satellite imagery, consider using software such as \[link to software\].*\]

## 4. Outputs

### 4.1 Output Files

| File Name                          | Type   | Description                                                                      |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| `land_use_change_map_[SUFFIX].tif` | Raster | Map depicting changes in land use between the specified time periods.            |
| `transition_matrix_[SUFFIX].csv`   | CSV    | Table showing the area of land that transitioned between each land use category. |
| `report_[SUFFIX].html`             | HTML   | A report summarizing the analysis results with visualizations and tables.        |
| ...                                | ...    | ...                                                                              |

\[Include rows for ALL output files, including the report.\]

### 4.2 Report Interpretation

\[This section will guide users on understanding the content of the generated report.\] \[Provide specific examples of how to interpret findings from the report, addressing real-world planning concerns.
Example: - *If the report shows a significant increase in deforestation within a protected area, policymakers could use this information to investigate the causes and strengthen enforcement efforts.* - *The transition matrix can help identify which land use types are most prone to conversion, allowing planners to target those areas with conservation or sustainable management practices.*\]

## 5. Theoretical Background

### 5.1 Model Description

\[Explain the underlying model or algorithm conceptually, using diagrams or flowcharts.
Avoid code.
Example: - *This module uses a simple change detection method to identify pixels that have changed land use category between the input maps.* - *(Include a diagram showing how change detection works)*\]

### 5.2 Key Assumptions

-   \[List the key assumptions made by the model. Example:
    -   *The land cover maps accurately represent land use categories.*
    -   *Land use changes occur linearly over the analysis period.*\]

### 5.3 Limitations

-   \[Explain the model's limitations and potential sources of error/uncertainty. Example:
    -   *This module does not account for gradual land use changes or changes that occur within a single land use category.*
    -   *Accuracy is limited by the quality and resolution of the input land cover maps.*\]
