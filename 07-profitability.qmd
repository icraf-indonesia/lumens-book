## 1. Description

The Profitability Analysis module helps users calculate the economic benefits of land-use change scenarios.
The analysis focuses on assessing **Net Present Value (NPV)**, **Opportunity Cost**, and **Carbon Emissions**.
This method evaluates both the financial and environmental impacts, helping to identify trade-offs between economic development and environmental sustainability.

## 2. Usage

### 2.1 Workflow

This module integrates economic and ecological data to assess the environmental and financial impacts of land-use changes, supporting sustainable land management decisions.
The workflow consists of the following steps:

1.  **NPV and Carbon Data Processing**: Combining NPV and carbon data into a lookup table.
2.  **Land-Use Change Analysis**: Processing land-use change maps to assess NPV and carbon emission changes.
3.  **Opportunity Cost Calculation**: Building an opportunity cost table by evaluating differences between carbon emissions and financial gains across land uses.
4.  **Visualization**: Generating maps and plotting an opportunity cost curve to represent the trade-offs between financial gains and carbon emissions.

### 2.2 Step-by-step Instructions

**Step 1: Uploading Land Cover Data**

In this step, you'll upload four datasets required for analysis.

#### \[Upload Land Cover Map at T1\]

![](images/clipboard-2804689983.png)

1.  **Click the "Browse" Button** in the "Land Cover Map at T1" section.
2.  **Select your Land Cover Map (GeoTIFF format)** for **Time Period 1 (T1)**, representing land cover at the beginning of your analysis period.
3.  **Ensure Proper Projection and Resolution**: Use **UTM projection** and ensure a resolution of **at least 100m x 100m**.

#### \[Upload Land Cover Map at T2\]

![](images/clipboard-3312463142.png)

1.  **Click the "Browse" Button** in the "Land Cover Map at T2" section.
2.  **Select your Land Cover Map (GeoTIFF format)** for **Time Period 2 (T2)**.
3.  **Ensure Correct Projection and Resolution** as with T1.

#### \[Upload NPV Lookup Table\]

![](images/clipboard-1622649468.png)

1.  **Click the "Browse" Button** in the "NPV Lookup Table" section.
2.  **Select the NPV Lookup Table (CSV format)**, containing economic values per land use type.

#### \[Upload QUES-C Table\]

![](images/clipboard-690971442.png)

1.  **Click the "Browse" Button** in the "QUES-C Table" section.
2.  **Select the QUES-C Table (CSV format)**, which includes carbon values for each land use type.

#### **Step 2: Setting Analysis Parameters**

1.  **Set the years** for each land-use map to mark the start (T1) and end (T2) of your analysis.
2.  **Enter 'No Data' Information** (use '0').
3.  **Select Output Directory** where results will be saved.

#### **Step 3: Running the Analysis**

Once all data is uploaded and parameters are set, run the analysis.
Results will appear in the "Results" tab.

### 2.3 Tips

-   Ensure that all input maps have consistent projection and resolution for accurate analysis.
-   Larger datasets may take longer to process, so plan accordingly.

### 4.2 Report Interpretation

This section provides examples on how to interpret results, such as identifying areas with significant land use changes and their implications for policy or management.

## 5. Theoretical Background

### 5.1 Model Description

Explain the underlying model conceptually using diagrams or flowcharts.
For example, this module uses change detection methods to identify pixels that have changed land-use categories between the input maps.

### 5.2 Key Assumptions

-   Land cover maps accurately represent land use categories.
-   Land use changes occur linearly over the analysis period.

### 5.3 Limitations

-   Does not account for gradual land use changes within a single land use category.
-   Analysis accuracy is limited by the quality and resolution of the input data.
