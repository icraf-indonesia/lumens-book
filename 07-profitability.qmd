## 1. Description

<<<<<<< HEAD
The Profitability Analysis module helps user to calculate the economic benefit based on land-use change scenarios. The analysis focuses on assessing the **Net Present Value (NPV)**, **Opportunity Cost**, and **Carbon Emissions** associated with different land-use changes. This method evaluates the financial and environmental impacts of identify trade-offs between environment and economy.

## 2. Usage

### 2.1 Workflow

<<<<<<< HEAD
To effectively assess the environmental and financial impacts of land-use changes, this approach integrates economic and ecological data, providing a comprehensive analysis that supports decision-making in sustainable land management.

The analysis workflow involves several key steps:

1.  **NPV and Carbon Data Processing**: NPV and carbon data were combined to create a comprehensive lookup table.
2.  **Land-Use Change Analysis**: The land-use change maps were processed to assess changes in NPV and carbon emissions.
3.  **Opportunity Cost Calculation**: The opportunity cost table was built by evaluating the difference between carbon emissions and financial gains across different land uses.
4.  **Visualization**: Maps were generated to visually represent the spatial distribution of NPV changes, carbon emissions, and opportunity costs. Additionally, an opportunity cost curve was plotted to illustrate the trade-off between financial gains and carbon emissions.

### 2.2 Step-by-step instructions

By following the steps outlined below, users can process critical data, evaluate trade-offs between carbon emissions and financial returns, and visualize the outcomes in a way that informs strategic planning

**Step 1: Uploading Land Cover Data**

In this step, you will upload four different types of data required for the analysis. Follow these steps carefully to ensure successful data upload.

[**Upload Land Cover Map at T1**]{.underline}

![](images/clipboard-2804689983.png)

1.  **Click the "Browse" Button**\
    In the "Land Cover Map at T1" section, click the "Browse" button.

2.  **Select Your Land Cover Map (GeoTIFF format)**\
    Choose the land cover map file for **Time Period 1 (T1)** from your computer. This map represents the land cover at the beginning of your analysis period, for example, the first year.

3.  **Ensure Proper Projection and Resolution**\
    Verify that the map is projected in **UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator)** and has a resolution of at least **100m x 100m** for accurate spatial analysis.

#### [**Upload Land Cover Map at T2**]{.underline}

![](images/clipboard-3312463142.png)

1.  **Click the "Browse" Button**\
    Now, locate the "Land Cover Map at T2" section and click the "Browse" button.

2.  **Select Your Land Cover Map for T2 (GeoTIFF format)**\
    Choose the land cover map for **Time Period 2 (T2)** from your computer. This map represents the land cover at the end of the analysis period, for example, the last year.

3.  **Ensure Correct Projection and Resolution**\
    As with T1, make sure the map is projected to **UTM** and has a resolution of **100m x 100m**.

#### [**Upload NPV Lookup Table**]{.underline}

![](images/clipboard-1622649468.png)

1.  **Click the "Browse" Button**\
    In the "NPV Lookup Table" section, click the "Browse" button.

2.  **Select the NPV Lookup Table (CSV format)**\
    Locate and select the NPV lookup table file from your computer. This table contains the **economic value (in IDR or USD)** per type of land use (measured in hectares).

#### [**Upload QUES-C Table**]{.underline}

![](images/clipboard-690971442.png)

1.  **Click the "Browse" Button**\
    In the "QUES-C Table" section, click the "Browse" button.

2.  **Select the QUES-C Table (CSV format)**\
    Choose the QUES-C table file from your computer. This table includes the **carbon value (measured in CO2eq)** per land use type, calculated in hectares. The data comes from QUES-C, which is a tool used for carbon accounting.

#### **Step 2: Setting Analysis Parameters**

Enter the year for each land use map time period marking the start and end years for your analysis. For example: 2005 for T1 and 2010 for T2.

### 2.3 Tips

-   **Land Cover Maps (T1 and T2)**: These maps help analyze the change in land use between two specific periods, showing how land use has evolved over time.

    Your data should look like this:
