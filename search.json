    "text": "5.3 Data Preparation\nBefore using the QuES-B Analysis tool, prepare the following:\n\nLand Cover Map: A raster file of current land use/land cover (LULC) in GeoTIFF format.\nLand Use/Cover & Focal Area Lookup Table: A CSV file describing raster values with their corresponding land cover classes. Users define focal areas by selecting specific land cover classes.\nEdge Contrast Table: An FSQ file defining edge contrast between land cover types.\n(Optional) FRAGSTATS Configuration file.\n\n\n5.3.1 Using the QuES-B Analysis Tool\nFollow these steps to use the tool:\n\nLand Cover\n\nClick “Browse” and select your prepared land cover raster file. This must be in GeoTIFF format with the relevant UTM projection system.\n\nYear\n\nEnter the year of your land cover data (e.g., 2010). This must be numeric.\n\nNo Data Class\n\nEnter the value representing missing land cover data in your raster, e.g., cloud or shadow (default is 0).\n\nLand Use/Cover & Focal Area Lookup Table\n\nClick “Browse” and select your prepared CSV file. Refer to the manual and example data for the correct column arrangement.\n\nEdge Contrast Table\n\nClick “Browse” and select your prepared FSQ file. Refer to the manual and example data for the correct column arrangement.\n\nSampling Points\n\nEnter the number of sampling points (default is 1000). This is used to generate sampling grids for calculating DIFA. A higher number provides finer DIFA estimation but requires more computing time and resources.\n\nWindow Size\n\nEnter the size of the moving window for analysis in meters (default is 1000). Window size represents the dispersal radius, a threshold for ecological connectivity, assuming that taxa associated with the focal area can typically move or disperse up to this distance.\n\nWindow Shape\n\nSelect the shape of the moving window (default is Square). Circle shape is more realistic but requires more computing resources and time.\n\nFRAGSTATS Configuration\n\n(Optional) Click “Browse” to select a FRAGSTATS configuration file. A default file will be used if not specified. Refer to the manual for further details.\n\nFRAGSTATS Path\n\n(Optional) Enter the path to your FRAGSTATS installation. Specify the path to the Fragstats directory installed on your PC if you used a custom installation directory. The default path will be used if not specified, assuming the default Fragstats installation directory.\n\nOutput Directory\n\nClick “Select Output Directory” to choose where results will be saved.\n\nRun Analysis\n\nClick “Run QuES-B Analysis” to start the process.",

    "text": "5.4 Accessing Outputs\nAfter the analysis completes, you’ll find the following in your selected output directory:\n\nFocal Area Map: A binary raster map in GeoTIFF format derived from the land cover map, displaying the user-defined focal area classes represented as 1.\nTECI Map: A raster map in GeoTIFF format illustrating the spatial distribution of focal area fragmentation and integration across the landscape. It measures the contrast between adjacent land cover types. Lower TECI values indicate well-integrated areas with minimal contrast between adjacent land cover types. Conversely, higher TECI values represent more segregated areas with greater contrast between neighboring land uses. Gray areas represent areas outside the dispersal threshold from the focal area.\nSampling Grid: A polygon shapefile of sampling grids used to extract values of TECI and focal area size.\nDIFA Plot: A plot illustrating the Degree of Integration of Focal Area (DIFA) Index, which measures how well integrated the focal habitat is within the landscape. The x-axis represents the Total Edge Contrast Index (TECI), while the y-axis shows the cumulative proportion of focal area. The curve depicts the relationship between habitat fragmentation (TECI) and habitat amount. The area under this curve determines the DIFA score, ranging from 0 to 100%. Higher scores indicate better habitat integration.\nQuES-B Report: An overview of the analysis results in HTML format, providing detailed interpretations and visualizations of these outputs.\n\n\nFor more detailed information or troubleshooting, refer to the full QuES-B documentation or contact the tool developers.\nLUMENS is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
