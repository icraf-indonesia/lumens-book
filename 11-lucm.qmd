## 1. Description

\[The *Land Use Change Modelling using Dinamica* module in LUMENS simulates future land use/cover changes using a time and space model.
It incorporates variables such as elevation, proximity to roads, and other regional characteristics to predict land use dynamics.
This module uses result from *Scenario Builder* by providing data-driven insights into how different factors influence land use over time.
There are two parts: **Train Model and Simulate**.

Policymakers can use this tool to explore the outcomes of various development, conservation, and land management strategies, enabling informed decisions to address challenges like deforestation and infrastructure development while balancing environmental sustainability and growth.\]

## 2. Usage

### 2.1 Workflow

\[*Land Use Change Modelling using Dinamica* module in LUMENS begins with data preparation, where users upload land cover maps from different time periods, along with a look-up table that defines land cover classes and land use types.
These inputs are critical for calibrating the model.
Next, users select relevant spatial variables such as elevation, distance to roads, and slope, which influence land use changes in the region.
The model then trains by overlaying historical land cover data and selected variables to detect patterns in land use change.
Afterward, users configure future scenarios by adjusting variables*.* The module runs the simulation based on these inputs, generating predictive maps and statistical outputs that show potential future land use changes and emissions.*\]*

### 2.2 Step-by-step instructions

### Step 1: Uploading Land Cover Data

1.  **Upload Land Cover Map**:

    -   Click the *"Upload Raster"* button.

    -   Select your land cover map (in GeoTIFF format) from your computer.

    -   Once uploaded, confirm the map appears in the interface.

        *(Screenshot )*

2.  **Input Year**:

    -   Input the corresponding year for the land cover map in the *"Year"* field.

3.  **Upload Land Use Matrix**:

    -   Click the *"Upload Land Use Matrix"* button.

    -   Select your land use matrix file, which defines transitions between land use categories.

    -   Confirm the matrix is correctly loaded.

4.  **Upload Planning Unit**:

    -   Click the *"Upload Planning Unit"* button.

    -   Select your planning unit layer, which represents the spatial boundaries for analysis.

5.  **Add Factor or Folder Path**

### Step 2: Training the Model

1.  Click the *"Run Analysis"* button.

2.  The system will process the inputs, using the land cover map, year, and land use matrix to identify land use transitions.

3.  A progress bar will indicate the training status.

4.  Once complete, the results will be saved and available for use in the next step.

### Step 3: Simulating Future Scenarios

1.  **Navigate to the "Simulate" Tab**:

    -   Once training is complete, click on the *"Simulate"* tab.

2.  **Input QUES-C Table**:

    -   Upload the *QUES-C* table, which contains the parameters needed for future simulations.

3.  **Select Trained Model**:

    -   From the dropdown menu, select the previously trained model as the input for simulation.

4.  **Set Repetition Number**:

    -   Enter the *number of iterations* for the simulation in the *"Repetition"* field. This value determines how many iterations the model will run to generate reliable projections.

### Step 4: Running the Simulation

1.  **Run Simulation**:

    -   Click the *"Run Analysis"* button to start the process.

    -   A progress bar will appear, indicating the simulation's status.

    -   Once complete, the results, will be displayed in the *"Output Directory".*

### Step 5: Analyzing Results

1.  **View Results**:

    -   Navigate to the *"Results"* tab to view simulated land use maps and detailed statistical outputs.

    -   Use the analysis outputs to interpret future land use patterns and their potential impacts.

### 2.3 Tips

-   \[Provide helpful hints or things to consider while using the module. Example:
    -   *For large datasets, the analysis may take some time to complete.*
    -   *Ensure that all input maps have the same extent and resolution.* \]

### 4.2 Report Interpretation

\[This section will guide users on understanding the content of the generated report.\] \[Provide specific examples of how to interpret findings from the report, addressing real-world planning concerns.
Example: - *If the report shows a significant increase in deforestation within a protected area, policymakers could use this information to investigate the causes and strengthen enforcement efforts.* - *The transition matrix can help identify which land use types are most prone to conversion, allowing planners to target those areas with conservation or sustainable management practices.*\]

## 5. Theoretical Background

### 5.1 Model Description

\[Explain the underlying model or algorithm conceptually, using diagrams or flowcharts.
Avoid code.
Example: - *This module uses a simple change detection method to identify pixels that have changed land use category between the input maps.* - *(Include a diagram showing how change detection works)*\]

### 5.2 Key Assumptions

-   \[List the key assumptions made by the model. Example:
    -   *The land cover maps accurately represent land use categories.*
    -   *Land use changes occur linearly over the analysis period.*\]

### 5.3 Limitations

-   \[Explain the model's limitations and potential sources of error/uncertainty. Example:
    -   *This module does not account for gradual land use changes or changes that occur within a single land use category.*
    -   *Accuracy is limited by the quality and resolution of the input land cover maps.*\]
